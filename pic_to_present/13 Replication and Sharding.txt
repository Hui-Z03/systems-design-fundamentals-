Replication & Sharding

Replication —— maintaining multiple copies of DB or components across the system. (maybe in different locations)
		1 Master-Slave Replication: master-write data in; slave-read only
		2 Master-Master Replication: synchronous write data in
		3 Aync-Replication: no consistency
		4 Sync-Replication: only writing data into all replication is done, or nothing done. High consistency

		* for bank:  Master-Slave Replication + Sync Replication.    For Strong consistency and High Availability
				used in 'account balance' 'transfer record' etc.
		<Oracle Data Guard> is a product is commonly used in bank industry


Sharding —— splits a large dataset into smaller, independent pieces. (shards)
		carefully choose hash function for balanced sharding,
		use reverse proxy in front of shards, to handle requests, distribute requests to shards
