Rate Limiting


Rate Limiter —— control the number of requests a user or system can make to a service within a given time period.
		to prevent overloaded & abuse (dos/Ddos attack )

		Redis is commonly used to implement Rate Limiting. It's in Cach, it's fast, atomic operations


an example of Rate Limiting in a simple system:
	Client → Load Balancer / API Gateway → Rate Limiter → API Server → Database
		DB前也可以加 rate limiter, 保护数据，防DDos
		if system has third party service, set Rate Limiter in front of third party API
