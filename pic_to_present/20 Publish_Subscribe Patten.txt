Publish/Subscribe Pattern


pub/sub pattern —— a messaging model set in between sender(pub) and receiver(sub), 
			it receive messages from pub (pub don't need to know who is receiving),
				sub is listening to it to get messages.

				e.g. Google Cloud pub/sub; Apache Kafka

			conmmonly used for order system; chat; checking stock price
					fillter, e.g.   subA want information 1 2 3, but subB want 2 3 4

	easy to scale; Async; data be stored (persistence)
		
	don't use it for *consistence*. For example: bank transfer system, ask for strong consistence.
		can be used for other sub around the transfer but not that consistence, like notice, send record for audit

当一个消息，有很多sub 聆听者时，而且这些sub相对独立，没有互相影响的时候，适用 pub/sub pattren
