Relational Databases


Relational Database (SQL) —— store data in tables (spreadsheet), tables can be connected to each other

ACID, it's an important concept in SQL database
A - Atomicity (all or nothing), all steps in a package. Either the package (all steps) happen, or none happen
	e.g. bank transfer 
C - Consistency, always follow the rules. To make sure that you will always see a database - all transaction are completed, no "on going"
							读取数据库时，只能看到一个“已完成，合法的DB”
I - Isolation,  even multiple transactions can occur same time, *but  they are executed one by one.

D - Durability, once a transaction is done, it is saved in DB, even the system crashes right after.

A	Atomicity		All or nothing
C	Consistency	Data stays valid
I	Isolation		No interference from other users
D	Durability		Changes are saved permanently


database index: to database, like a table of contents in a book. It can help find data faster, without scanning rows one by one.
	
	(advantage, faster search, better performance)
	(disadvantage, slower inserts data, use more storage)
		—— sth to think when trade-offs

Master-Slave Replication: primary database (only write into), slave databases (read only). 
	—— a classic way to scale sql database
