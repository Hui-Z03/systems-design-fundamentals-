Load Balancers

Load balancer —— a tool that distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers, so no single server gets overloaded. (a kind of reverse proxy)
		1 hardware LB; 2 software LB; 3 cloud-base LB

Traffic distribution methods:
	1 Round Robin, send request to the next server in line/ take turns. 
			For login server, all servers are similar
		"weighted round robin": still take turns, but send more to more powerful server
			when servers have different capacities
	2 IP Hash, route base on client's IP (always send the same user/IP to the same server), for 'session stickiness 对话粘性'
		  e.g. shopping eshop, your cart info will be in the same server, so the cart stays CONSISTENT.
	3 Path-based (or URL-based routing), routes to what the user is asking for 
		base on URL, route to pay/ image/ api/ login 
	4 Least Connections, send request to the server with the fewest active. 
		For maintain long/ variable sessions (e.g. video streaming, chat APP)
