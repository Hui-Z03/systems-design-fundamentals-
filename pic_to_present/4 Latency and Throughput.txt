Latency & Throughput

Latency —— how long it takes for data to traverse a system

Throughput —— how much work a machine can perform in a given period of time
		(how much data can be transferred from 1 point to another poin in a system)

don't make assumptions about latency/throughput based on the other, 
look for the "bottleneck",  it may be "latency" or "throughput".
