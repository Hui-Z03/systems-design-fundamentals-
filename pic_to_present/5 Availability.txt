Availability

Availability —— how 'resistant' a system is to failures (system fault tolerance)
		running time in the % of time in a given period of time, e.g. 50% availability
		Nines, (describe availability): 4 nines means 99.99%, 3nines means 99.9% availability
		* five nines is gold standard of availability
		* HA (high availability) is a method to approach

SLA —— service level agreement, between customer &service provider
		remember to check the percentage of availability in the SLA

SLO —— service level objective, an goal inside the team to  achieve

SLI —— service level indicator,  a historical data that shows service level

	availability 是系统设计最重要的考量之一
		HA可能引起 higher latency/lower throughput, high cost，
		思考系统中哪部分绝对不能宕机，哪里可以（trade-offs）

Redundancy(冗余) —— duplicating or multiplying certain parts of the system, 
			if you need to eliminate single points of failure—use redundant, and use load balancer

		Active redundancy: multiple entities performing the same task at same time
		Passive redundancy: keep backup inactive until needed
